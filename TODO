Declaration of intent:

1. program which reads from stdin to a buffer, and prints to stdout when full
   - test by piping the music from a.out to aplay via the program

2. program which opens a canHandle, then reads from stdin to a buffer and sends
   a canMessage when the buffer is full.
   - should take channel as argument (default 0)
   - should take help argument
   - should maybe take optional msg ID as argument
   - should maybe take optional dlc as argument

3. program which opens a canHandle, then reads canMessages and prints their
   contents to stdout
   - should take channel as argument (default 1)
   - should take help argument
   - should maybe take optional msg ID as argument
   - should maybe take optional dlc as argument

4. test 2 and 3 together by piping a.out to 2, and piping 3 to aplay in a
   different terminal (preferably on a different machine)


Work log:
 - Implemeted main frame work including argument parsing and overall structure


Remains:
 - Check return status from parsing
 - Use parsed arguments to initialise handle
 - Notify user that CAN FD is not yet supported
 - Read from stdin and sent messages in upstream
 - Read messages and print to stdout in downstream
 - CAN FD support
 - Add to GitHub
